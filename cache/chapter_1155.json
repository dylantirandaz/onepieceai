href=\"/wiki/Harald\" title=\"Harald\">King Harald</a> at the <a href=\"/wiki/Levely\" title=\"Levely\">Levely</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_D._Xebec\" title=\"Rocks D. Xebec\">Rocks</a> became notorious across the <a href=\"/wiki/Blue_Planet\" title=\"Blue Planet\">world</a> for his attacks against the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Government\" title=\"World Government\">World Government</a>, and began recruiting powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Pirate\" title=\"Pirate\">pirates</a>. Eight years later at <a href=\"/wiki/Elbaph\" title=\"Elbaph\">Elbaph</a>, Rocks attacked <a href=\"/wiki/Loki\" title=\"Loki\">Loki</a> to force a meeting with Harald, and then spoke of his plans against the government. After Harald refused to join him, Rocks officially formed his <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_Pirates\" title=\"Rocks Pirates\">crew</a> and began his ambition to take over the world.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Long_Summary\">Long Summary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a title=\"Sign in to edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" data-tracking-label=\"log-in-edit-section\" data-action=\"edit-section\" href=\"https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fonepiece.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FChapter_1155%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&amp;uselang=en\" data-testid=\"log-in-edit-section\"><svg class=\"wds-icon wds-icon-tiny\"><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-pencil-tiny\"></use></svg></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Loki\" title=\"Loki\">Loki</a> confirms that <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_D._Xebec\" title=\"Rocks D. Xebec\">Rocks</a> and his crew are on <a href=\"/wiki/Elbaph\" title=\"Elbaph\">Elbaph</a> while he muses that this is the first time he has ever seen humans. Rocks is surprised to learn that Loki is <a href=\"/wiki/Harald\" title=\"Harald\">Harald</a>'s son and orders him to go home and have someone contact Harald to tell him that his son has been badly hurt, and he needs to return home at once. Loki refuses as he thinks Rocks is weaker than him, and also because he feels Harald would not do something like that for him. Loki tries to attack Rocks but is easily blown away, as Rocks has a reputation for blowing everything away with his sword like it was a hammer or a cannonball. Rocks laughs at the injury he gave Loki, saying he now has a legitimate reason to call him.\n</p><p>At the <a href=\"/wiki/Levely\" title=\"Levely\">Levely</a> that Harald snuck into, Rocks, who was there, caused a commotion not only by attacking and abducting five kings in attendance, but actually managed to reach the Room of Flowers and meet <a href=\"/wiki/Imu\" title=\"Imu\">Imu</a> (though this part was never mentioned). Rocks' attempt to use the kings as bargaining chips failed as Imu expressed no care for them, and ultimately Rocks left, but not before promising Imu that he would one day return to this very room. At the same time, Harald was blamed for Rocks' actions and being pursued through the <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Geoise\" title=\"Mary Geoise\">Holy Land</a>. As Rocks was fleeing, the both of them saw another and attacked, Harald doing so out of anger that Rocks was making him take the fall for his actions, and Rocks needing him out of his way. The clash of the two's <a href=\"/wiki/Haki/Supreme_King_Haki\" title=\"Haki/Supreme King Haki\">Haki</a> ended up being so strong that it blew away anyone that was within five kilometers of them. After introducing each other, Rocks advised Harald aim his next blow at the town, for if he is captured, he will be enslaved. Though confused, Harald did so and the two continued running away with Rocks telling him which way to go. Rocks told Harald that if he survives they should meet again as he literally jumps off the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Line\" title=\"Red Line\">Red Line</a>, but Harald refuses to associate with him as he is a criminal. It was following that day that Rocks became a notoriously wanted man due to his crimes, particularly fatally wounding a&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Admiral\" title=\"Admiral\">Marine Admiral</a>. Some time later, he attacked a <a href=\"/wiki/World_Government\" title=\"World Government\">World Government</a> ship carrying the Heavenly Tribute of the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Noble\" title=\"World Noble\">World Nobles</a> and destroyed the <a href=\"/wiki/Gates_of_Justice\" title=\"Gates of Justice\">Gates of Justice</a>. With the ship and money, Rocks began his pirating career, participating in <a href=\"/wiki/Davy_Back_Fight\" title=\"Davy Back Fight\">Davy Back Fights</a> to win crew members, and by the time he had reached Elbaph, he had six powerful people under his banner, though at the time they were not an official crew.\n</p><p>Loki contacted Harald and was surprised (if not somewhat in disbelief) that he did indeed come home to see him, but Harald had no idea that Loki tried to kill himself and instead assumed he fell off a cliff and he should stay away from the Underworld. Harald asks Rocks why he is in Elbaph and Rocks tells him that he wants him to join his crew. Harald refuses as he knows it will destroy the relations that he has built thus far, even though Rocks tells him that as giants they can do whatever they pleased to avoid becoming a government dog, rather than try to say everyone is equal. Harald states that Elbaph is changing for the better now but Rocks refutes this, claiming that people's true nature never changes and that his bloodlust from his youth is still there.\n</p><p>Harald tells Rocks' crew that if they follow him, only disaster will wait for them. <a href=\"/wiki/Shiki\" title=\"Shiki\">Shiki</a>, back when he was a mobster, states that he has no loyalty to Rocks and would not care if he died. <a href=\"/wiki/Buckingham_Stussy\" title=\"Buckingham Stussy\">Miss Buckin</a>, also known as the \"Science Robber\", shares the sentiment, but also reveals that Rocks has a plan to make everyone present rich. A <a href=\"/wiki/West_Blue\" title=\"West Blue\">West Blue</a> gangster named <a href=\"/wiki/Marlon\" title=\"Marlon\">Don Marlon</a> asks Harald if he has heard of <a href=\"/wiki/Hachinosu\" title=\"Hachinosu\">Hachinosu</a>, more commonly known as \"Pirate Island\"; in the past it was previously used to punish criminals that individual countries could not handle in their own prisons, and according to a young <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Newgate\" title=\"Edward Newgate\">Edward Newgate</a>, the island has no food and everyone sent there would eventually die. <a href=\"/wiki/Ochoku\" title=\"Ochoku\">Ochoku</a>, known as the \"Pirate Guru\", reveals that in recent years, the criminals sent there were able to build a settlement, which a smuggler named <a href=\"/wiki/Ganzui\" title=\"Ganzui\">Ganzui</a> explains is because they found a huge supply of gold on the island, and when various underground organizations found out, they helped mine the gold, allowing the criminals to turn a huge profit, which the World Government is not happy about.\n</p><p>Rocks tells Harald that it is too difficult to get close to Hachinosu, so he made a deal with the World Government to claim the island for them in exchange for a fair payment, however, Rocks has no intention to do that and only wants to take the island for himself so he can transform it into a pirate paradise. Rocks declares that once Hachinosu is under his command, he will destroy the <a href=\"/wiki/Marines\" title=\"Marines\">Marines</a> and the Holy Land, and then he will fulfill his dream of becoming \"King of the World\". Harald warns Rocks that this plan will make him an enemy of said <a href=\"/wiki/Blue_Planet\" title=\"Blue Planet\">world</a> and it will be impossible, but Rocks has faith he can do it, as he also believes no organization ever lasts forever, and he wants him to join his crew believing his incredible strength will help him reach his goal. Harald still refused, but Loki, who overheard the conversation, became amazed by Rocks' plan, coming to see him as his salvation.\n</p><p>Four years later, Rocks' attempts to recruit Harald continuously failed, but despite that he was still able to amass a force powerful enough to take Hachinosu, thus the <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_Pirates\" title=\"Rocks Pirates\">Rocks Pirates</a> were officially born.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quick_References\">Quick References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a title=\"Sign in to edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" data-tracking-label=\"log-in-edit-section\" data-action=\"edit-section\" href=\"https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fonepiece.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FChapter_1155%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&amp;uselang=en\" data-testid=\"log-in-edit-section\"><svg class=\"wds-icon wds-icon-tiny\"><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-pencil-tiny\"></use></svg></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_Notes\">Chapter Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a title=\"Sign in to edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" data-tracking-label=\"log-in-edit-section\" data-action=\"edit-section\" href=\"https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fonepiece.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FChapter_1155%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&amp;uselang=en\" data-testid=\"log-in-edit-section\"><svg class=\"wds-icon wds-icon-tiny\"><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-pencil-tiny\"></use></svg></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Loki\" title=\"Loki\">Loki</a> confirms to <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_D._Xebec\" title=\"Rocks D.

Xebec|Rocks]] became notorious across the [[Blue Planet|world]] for his attacks against the [[World Government]], and began recruiting powerful [[pirate]]s. Eight years later at [[Elbaph]], Rocks attacked [[Loki]] to force a meeting with Harald, and then spoke of his plans against the government. After Harald refused to join him, Rocks officially formed his [[Rocks Pirates|crew]] and began his ambition to take over the world.\n\n==Long Summary==\n[[Loki]] confirms that [[Rocks D. Xebec|Rocks]] and his crew are on [[Elbaph]] while he muses that this is the first time he has ever seen humans. Rocks is surprised to learn that Loki is [[Harald]]'s son and orders him to go home and have someone contact Harald to tell him that his son has been badly hurt, and he needs to return home at once. Loki refuses as he thinks Rocks is weaker than him, and also because he feels Harald would not do something like that for him. Loki tries to attack Rocks but is easily blown away, as Rocks has a reputation for blowing everything away with his sword like it was a hammer or a cannonball. Rocks laughs at the injury he gave Loki, saying he now has a legitimate reason to call him.\n\nAt the [[Levely]] that Harald snuck into, Rocks, who was there, caused a commotion not only by attacking and abducting five kings in attendance, but actually managed to reach the Room of Flowers and meet [[Imu]] (though this part was never mentioned). Rocks' attempt to use the kings as bargaining chips failed as Imu expressed no care for them, and ultimately Rocks left, but not before promising Imu that he would one day return to this very room. At the same time, Harald was blamed for Rocks' actions and being pursued through the [[Mary Geoise|Holy Land]]. As Rocks was fleeing, the both of them saw another and attacked, Harald doing so out of anger that Rocks was making him take the fall for his actions, and Rocks needing him out of his way. The clash of the two's [[Haki/Supreme King Haki|Haki]] ended up being so strong that it blew away anyone that was within five kilometers of them. After introducing each other, Rocks advised Harald aim his next blow at the town, for if he is captured, he will be enslaved. Though confused, Harald did so and the two continued running away with Rocks telling him which way to go. Rocks told Harald that if he survives they should meet again as he literally jumps off the [[Red Line]], but Harald refuses to associate with him as he is a criminal. It was following that day that Rocks became a notoriously wanted man due to his crimes, particularly fatally wounding a [[Admiral|Marine Admiral]]. Some time later, he attacked a [[World Government]] ship carrying the Heavenly Tribute of the [[World Noble]]s and destroyed the [[Gates of Justice]]. With the ship and money, Rocks began his pirating career, participating in [[Davy Back Fight]]s to win crew members, and by the time he had reached Elbaph, he had six powerful people under his banner, though at the time they were not an official crew.\n\nLoki contacted Harald and was surprised (if not somewhat in disbelief) that he did indeed come home to see him, but Harald had no idea that Loki tried to kill himself and instead assumed he fell off a cliff and he should stay away from the Underworld. Harald asks Rocks why he is in Elbaph and Rocks tells him that he wants him to join his crew. Harald refuses as he knows it will destroy the relations that he has built thus far, even though Rocks tells him that as giants they can do whatever they pleased to avoid becoming a government dog, rather than try to say everyone is equal. Harald states that Elbaph is changing for the better now but Rocks refutes this, claiming that people's true nature never changes and that his bloodlust from his youth is still there.\n\nHarald tells Rocks' crew that if they follow him, only disaster will wait for them. [[Shiki]], back when he was a mobster, states that he has no loyalty to Rocks and would not care if he died. [[Buckingham Stussy|Miss Buckin]], also known as the \"Science Robber\", shares the sentiment, but also reveals that Rocks has a plan to make everyone present rich. A [[West Blue]] gangster named [[Marlon|Don Marlon]] asks Harald if he has heard of [[Hachinosu]], more commonly known as \"Pirate Island\"; in the past it was previously used to punish criminals that individual countries could not handle in their own prisons, and according to a young [[Edward Newgate]], the island has no food and everyone sent there would eventually die. [[Ochoku]], known as the \"Pirate Guru\", reveals that in recent years, the criminals sent there were able to build a settlement, which a smuggler named [[Ganzui]] explains is because they found a huge supply of gold on the island, and when various underground organizations found out, they helped mine the gold, allowing the criminals to turn a huge profit, which the World Government is not happy about.\n\nRocks tells Harald that it is too difficult to get close to Hachinosu, so he made a deal with the World Government to claim the island for them in exchange for a fair payment, however, Rocks has no intention to do that and only wants to take the island for himself so he can transform it into a pirate paradise. Rocks declares that once Hachinosu is under his command, he will destroy the [[Marines]] and the Holy Land, and then he will fulfill his dream of becoming \"King of the World\". Harald warns Rocks that this plan will make him an enemy of said [[Blue Planet|world]] and it will be impossible, but Rocks has faith he can do it, as he also believes no organization ever lasts forever, and he wants him to join his crew believing his incredible strength will help him reach his goal. Harald still refused, but Loki, who overheard the conversation, became amazed by Rocks' plan, coming to see him as his salvation.\n\nFour years later, Rocks' attempts to recruit Harald continuously failed, but despite that he was still able to amass a force powerful enough to take Hachinosu, thus the [[Rocks Pirates]] were officially born.\n\n==Quick References==\n===Chapter Notes===\n*[[Loki]] confirms to [[Rocks D. Xebec|Rocks]] that they are indeed on [[Elbaph]], and mentions that he is [[Harald]]'s son.\n**When Loki reveals that Harald is at sea, and refuses to call his father back, Rocks injures Loki to force Harald to return.\n*Rocks is revealed to be an exceptionally powerful [[swordsman]].\n*During the [[Levely]] 8 years prior, Rocks kidnapped five kings when he attacked.\n*Amidst the chaos, Rocks broke into the [[Pangaea Castle#Room of Flowers|Room of Flowers]] and encountered [[Imu]] and their attendant, [[Gunko]].\n**Rocks proclaimed himself a \"worshipper of [[Davy Jones]]\", and promised Imu to return one day.\n*As Harald and Rocks tried to escape [[Mary Geoise]], they encountered each other and clashed briefly.\n**Rocks and Harald are both revealed to possess [[Haki/Supreme King Haki|Supreme King Haki]].\n*Eventually, Rocks and Harald helped each other escape Mary Geoise.\n*Afterwards, Rocks received his [[Bounties|bounty]] for killing a [[Admiral|Marine admiral]]; he also pillaged a ship carrying the [[World Noble#Heavenly Tribute|Heavenly Tribute]] to Mary Geoise, during which Rocks destroyed one of the [[Gates of Justice]].\n*Rocks recruited his first crewmates from [[Davy Back Fight]]s.\n*Back in Elbaph, Loki is shocked to find that Harald did return for him, and Harald invites Rocks and his crew to his castle.\n**Rocks' crew at this point consisted of [[Edward Newgate]], [[Shiki]], [[Buckingham Stussy]], Don [[Marlon]], [[Ochoku]], and [[Ganzui]].\n*Rocks repeatedly invites Harald to join forces to tear down the Holy Land and rule the world.\n**While Harald refuses each time due to not wanting to destroy the good relations he has built, Loki is intrigued by Rocks' offer.\n*4 years later, Rocks would officially form the [[Rocks Pirates]].\n\n===Characters===\n{| class=\"CharTable\"\n![[Pirate]]s\n![[World Government]]\n!Citizens\n|-\n|\n;[[Rocks Pirates]]\n*[[Rocks D.
