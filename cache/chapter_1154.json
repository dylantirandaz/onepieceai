href=\"/wiki/Loki\" title=\"Loki\">Loki</a>'s birth, <a href=\"/wiki/Jorul\" title=\"Jorul\">Jorul</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Estrid\" title=\"Estrid\">Estrid</a> died as <a href=\"/wiki/Elbaph\" title=\"Elbaph\">Elbaph</a> suffered under severe weather events and a famine, causing many conflicts to break out. However, <a href=\"/wiki/Harald\" title=\"Harald\">Harald</a> returned to the island and restored stability as his diplomatic efforts resulted in many countries delivering aid to the giant kingdom. Seven years later, Harald spoke with <a href=\"/wiki/Jarul\" title=\"Jarul\">Jarul</a> about his difficulty dealing with the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Government\" title=\"World Government\">World Government</a>; Jarul told him about a <a href=\"/wiki/Shipwright\" title=\"Shipwright\">shipwright</a> group called <a href=\"/wiki/Galleila\" title=\"Galleila\">Galleila</a> that was somehow captured long ago, suggesting the giants possess an ancient enemy.\n</p><p>Eight years following this, Elbaph was prosperous under Harald's diplomatic rule. Loki, still revering the old ways, regularly rampaged around the kingdom and bullied <a href=\"/wiki/Hajrudin\" title=\"Hajrudin\">Hajrudin</a>, though was ultimately doing this to try to fill a void of love that Estrid had not given him and he even attempted to kill himself at points. One day however, Loki encountered a band of pirates led by <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_D._Xebec\" title=\"Rocks D. Xebec\">Rocks D. Xebec</a>, the father of <a href=\"/wiki/Marshall_D._Teach\" title=\"Marshall D. Teach\">Blackbeard</a>. Rocks was looking for Harald, who eight years earlier had witnessed him murder a&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Admiral\" title=\"Admiral\">Marine Admiral</a> at the <a href=\"/wiki/Levely\" title=\"Levely\">Levely</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Long_Summary\">Long Summary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a title=\"Sign in to edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" data-tracking-label=\"log-in-edit-section\" data-action=\"edit-section\" href=\"https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fonepiece.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FChapter_1154%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&amp;uselang=en\" data-testid=\"log-in-edit-section\"><svg class=\"wds-icon wds-icon-tiny\"><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-pencil-tiny\"></use></svg></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>During the year that <a href=\"/wiki/Charlotte_Linlin\" title=\"Charlotte Linlin\">Charlotte Linlin</a> killed <a href=\"/wiki/Jorul\" title=\"Jorul\">Jorul</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Elbaph\" title=\"Elbaph\">Elbaph</a> was plagued with recurring disasters that made it impossible to grow food or catch fish. <a href=\"/wiki/Estrid\" title=\"Estrid\">Estrid</a> continued to claim that these disasters were a result of <a href=\"/wiki/Loki\" title=\"Loki\">Loki</a>'s \"cursed\" existence and have continued because they did not eliminate him when she ordered it, but several giants were more inclined to believe it was all just a coincidence. The infant Loki tried to get close to his mother, but Estrid refused to see or acknowledge him, leaving the baby devastated.\n</p><p>The recurring disasters led to <a href=\"/wiki/Giants\" title=\"Giants\">Giants</a> attacking each other for survival, resulting in more deaths, and as the spirit of the people began to break, it became easier for them to believe Estrid's words about Loki's \"curse\" as their hearts began to weaken. This drove a giant to try and kill <a href=\"/wiki/Hajrudin\" title=\"Hajrudin\">Hajrudin</a> because he is Loki's older half brother, thinking doing so will save them, and <a href=\"/wiki/Ida\" title=\"Ida\">Ida</a> as well for \"seducing\" <a href=\"/wiki/Harald\" title=\"Harald\">Harald</a>. Thankfully, Harald returned in time to save both of them. Harald informs his people that he heard about the disasters overseas and he asked the countries they are aligned with for help, and they responded with banding together to provide enough food for all of them, and in turn, Harald promises to provide aid when they need it as thanks.\n</p><p>Shortly after Harald returned, Estrid finally passed from her illness, but she continued to deny her son to the very end. As such, the people believed Estrid died from Loki's \"curse\", and by the time Harald could hold Loki himself, he had become forced to wear bandages over his eyes, the guards claiming he had a \"condition\" that affected his eyes. In addition, Loki did not smile in the presence of his father, as he had already given up on the idea of love, though Harald never seemed to know what Estrid did to him. Though Harald's diplomatic mission paid off and helped his country survive the long winter, it ultimately took up too much of his time, and Loki was forced to be raised by Estrid's brother, who hated him just as much as she did. As for Ida, she opened up a bar in the Underworld welcome to all to visit, hoping that it will aid Harald in his goals.\n</p><p>Seven years later, Harald spoke with <a href=\"/wiki/Jarul\" title=\"Jarul\">Jarul</a> in his home where he told him he was at the <a href=\"/wiki/Levely\" title=\"Levely\">Levely</a> thanks to someone sneaking him in disguised as a soldier, but the council refused to listen to him, and if it had not been for the \"incident\" that resulted in a death, his cover would have been blown and he would be imprisoned. Changing topics, Jarul asks Harald if he has ever heard of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Galleila\" title=\"Galleila\">Galleila</a>\", a group of giant shipwrights. Harald says he has, though he thought they were just a myth, but Jarul confirms they existed, but after sailing to distant shores they sent back a letter saying they had been captured, which perplexed him as some of them were ancient giants. Harald asks Jarul if he thinks the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Government\" title=\"World Government\">World Government</a> was behind it, but Jarul is not sure; he knows their people had a great enemy in the past, but their history sank into the sea. The point that Jarul was trying to make with his story, though, was that he suspects Harald's inability to foster a good relation with the World Government is not due to him, but because of some ancient history between the two, as their people are seen as a threat to the rest of the world.  \n</p><p>As time passed, Harald had eight branches built on Elbaph to unify the country and promote trading, while people's dislike of Loki continued to increase as the <a href=\"/wiki/Asla\" title=\"Asla\">lucky horse</a> was found dead and later his uncle, though there were some who acknowledged him as the country's prince instead of Hajrudin. Harald, however, had become known as the best king their people ever had due to his dream of connecting Elbaph to the rest of the world and making it safe for their kind to live peacefully. Whenever Harald left on his trips, Loki would attack the villages with an army of beasts from the Underworld. Hajrudin tried standing up to him saying he needs to respect their father's decision to work with humans, but Loki refused to acknowledge them and strikes Hajrudin for talking back to him. This led to the future members of Hajrudin's crew running to his aid, which causes Loki to call Hajrudin and his friends losers for trying to look after each other. Nonetheless, despite all the harm and chaos he spread, nothing Loki did could fill the hole in his heart his mother left with her cruel words. One day, Loki decided to kill himself by jumping from the Sun World to the Underworld but his strong body protects him, leaving him despair that he cannot die.  \n</p><p>That same day would be the day Loki first met <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_D._Xebec\" title=\"Rocks D. Xebec\">Rocks</a> before he became captain of the <a href=\"/wiki/Rocks_Pirates\" title=\"Rocks Pirates\">Rocks Pirates</a>, as he had come to Elbaph to visit Harald. It turns out the two had met earlier at the Levely, and the \"incident\" that took place there was Rocks killing an <a href=\"/wiki/Admiral\" title=\"Admiral\">Admiral</a>, which made him a wanted man. In a surprising twist, Rocks is also stated to be the father of <a href=\"/wiki/Marshall_D._Teach\" title=\"Marshall D. Teach\">Blackbeard</a>, as his face is finally shown bearing resemblance to him.  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quick_References\">Quick References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a title=\"Sign in to edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" data-tracking-label=\"log-in-edit-section\" data-action=\"edit-section\" href=\"https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fonepiece.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FChapter_1154%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&amp;uselang=en\" data-testid=\"log-in-edit-section\"><svg class=\"wds-icon wds-icon-tiny\"><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-pencil-tiny\"></use></svg></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_Notes\">Chapter Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a title=\"Sign in to edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" data-tracking-label=\"log-in-edit-section\" data-action=\"edit-section\" href=\"https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fonepiece.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FChapter_1154%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&amp;uselang=en\" data-testid=\"log-in-edit-section\"><svg class=\"wds-icon wds-icon-tiny\"><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-pencil-tiny\"></use></svg></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li>During the year of <a href=\"/wiki/Loki\" title=\"Loki\">Loki</a>'s birth, conflict ensued between villages in <a href=\"/wiki/Elbaph\" title=\"Elbaph\">Elbaph</a>, and natural disasters continued to plague the nation to the brink of a famine.</li>\n<li>The baby Loki returns from the Underworld to see his mother <a href=\"/wiki/Estrid\" title=\"Estrid\">Estrid</a>, but is forced out of her room by the guards.</li>\n<li>When <a href=\"/wiki/Harald\" title=\"Harald\">Harald</a> returns, he announces to <a href=\"/wiki/Elbaph\" title=\"Elbaph\">Elbaph</a> that he negotiated with other nations to send aid to Elbaph to help them through their famine.</li>\n<li>After Estrid's death, Loki's eyes are kept behind bandages, and the guards claim to Harald that he has an eye condition.</li>\n<li>Estrid's older brother is appointed as Loki's steward, but eventually, he mysteriously dies as well.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Ida\" title=\"Ida\">Ida</a> opens a bar in Elbaph's Underworld.</li>\n<li>56 years ago, Harald visits <a href=\"/wiki/Jarul\" title=\"Jarul\">Jarul</a>'s house.\n<ul><li>Harald says he snuck into the recent <a href=\"/wiki/Levely\" title=\"Levely\">Levely</a> thanks to a fellow <a href=\"/wiki/King_(Title)\" title=\"King (Title)\">King</a>.

However, [[Harald]] returned to the island and restored stability as his diplomatic efforts resulted in many countries delivering aid to the giant kingdom. Seven years later, Harald spoke with [[Jarul]] about his difficulty dealing with the [[World Government]]; Jarul told him about a [[shipwright]] group called [[Galleila]] that was somehow captured long ago, suggesting the giants possess an ancient enemy.\n\nEight years following this, Elbaph was prosperous under Harald's diplomatic rule. Loki, still revering the old ways, regularly rampaged around the kingdom and bullied [[Hajrudin]], though was ultimately doing this to try to fill a void of love that Estrid had not given him and he even attempted to kill himself at points. One day however, Loki encountered a band of pirates led by [[Rocks D. Xebec]], the father of [[Marshall D. Teach|Blackbeard]]. Rocks was looking for Harald, who eight years earlier had witnessed him murder a [[Admiral|Marine Admiral]] at the [[Levely]].\n\n==Long Summary==\nDuring the year that [[Charlotte Linlin]] killed [[Jorul]], [[Elbaph]] was plagued with recurring disasters that made it impossible to grow food or catch fish. [[Estrid]] continued to claim that these disasters were a result of [[Loki]]'s \"cursed\" existence and have continued because they did not eliminate him when she ordered it, but several giants were more inclined to believe it was all just a coincidence. The infant Loki tried to get close to his mother, but Estrid refused to see or acknowledge him, leaving the baby devastated.\n\nThe recurring disasters led to [[Giants]] attacking each other for survival, resulting in more deaths, and as the spirit of the people began to break, it became easier for them to believe Estrid's words about Loki's \"curse\" as their hearts began to weaken. This drove a giant to try and kill [[Hajrudin]] because he is Loki's older half brother, thinking doing so will save them, and [[Ida]] as well for \"seducing\" [[Harald]]. Thankfully, Harald returned in time to save both of them. Harald informs his people that he heard about the disasters overseas and he asked the countries they are aligned with for help, and they responded with banding together to provide enough food for all of them, and in turn, Harald promises to provide aid when they need it as thanks.\n\nShortly after Harald returned, Estrid finally passed from her illness, but she continued to deny her son to the very end. As such, the people believed Estrid died from Loki's \"curse\", and by the time Harald could hold Loki himself, he had become forced to wear bandages over his eyes, the guards claiming he had a \"condition\" that affected his eyes. In addition, Loki did not smile in the presence of his father, as he had already given up on the idea of love, though Harald never seemed to know what Estrid did to him. Though Harald's diplomatic mission paid off and helped his country survive the long winter, it ultimately took up too much of his time, and Loki was forced to be raised by Estrid's brother, who hated him just as much as she did. As for Ida, she opened up a bar in the Underworld welcome to all to visit, hoping that it will aid Harald in his goals.\n\nSeven years later, Harald spoke with [[Jarul]] in his home where he told him he was at the [[Levely]] thanks to someone sneaking him in disguised as a soldier, but the council refused to listen to him, and if it had not been for the \"incident\" that resulted in a death, his cover would have been blown and he would be imprisoned. Changing topics, Jarul asks Harald if he has ever heard of \"[[Galleila]]\", a group of giant shipwrights. Harald says he has, though he thought they were just a myth, but Jarul confirms they existed, but after sailing to distant shores they sent back a letter saying they had been captured, which perplexed him as some of them were ancient giants. Harald asks Jarul if he thinks the [[World Government]] was behind it, but Jarul is not sure; he knows their people had a great enemy in the past, but their history sank into the sea. The point that Jarul was trying to make with his story, though, was that he suspects Harald's inability to foster a good relation with the World Government is not due to him, but because of some ancient history between the two, as their people are seen as a threat to the rest of the world.  \n\nAs time passed, Harald had eight branches built on Elbaph to unify the country and promote trading, while people's dislike of Loki continued to increase as the [[Asla|lucky horse]] was found dead and later his uncle, though there were some who acknowledged him as the country's prince instead of Hajrudin. Harald, however, had become known as the best king their people ever had due to his dream of connecting Elbaph to the rest of the world and making it safe for their kind to live peacefully. Whenever Harald left on his trips, Loki would attack the villages with an army of beasts from the Underworld. Hajrudin tried standing up to him saying he needs to respect their father's decision to work with humans, but Loki refused to acknowledge them and strikes Hajrudin for talking back to him. This led to the future members of Hajrudin's crew running to his aid, which causes Loki to call Hajrudin and his friends losers for trying to look after each other. Nonetheless, despite all the harm and chaos he spread, nothing Loki did could fill the hole in his heart his mother left with her cruel words. One day, Loki decided to kill himself by jumping from the Sun World to the Underworld but his strong body protects him, leaving him despair that he cannot die.  \n\nThat same day would be the day Loki first met [[Rocks D. Xebec|Rocks]] before he became captain of the [[Rocks Pirates]], as he had come to Elbaph to visit Harald. It turns out the two had met earlier at the Levely, and the \"incident\" that took place there was Rocks killing an [[Admiral]], which made him a wanted man. In a surprising twist, Rocks is also stated to be the father of [[Marshall D.
